**Neutron is a high level general-purpose programming language that is inspired by C and Python.**

# Example
Here is how to do the guess the number game in neutron:

```java
import "types";
import "io";
import "random::randrange";

is_not_win = true;
number = randrange(0, 100);
num_guesses = 0;

while (is_not_win) {
  guess = types::to_int(io::stdin(prompt="Enter A Number Between 0 and 100: "));
  if (guess == number) {
    io::print("You Win!");
    is_not_win = false;
  } else if (guess < number) {
    io::print("Too Low");
  } else if (guess > number) {
    io::print("Too High");
  }
}
```

# Documentation
**[There is a documentation here](https://the-neutron-foundation.github.io/)** for full documentation and installation instructions. There is also a [Gitter Chat here](https://gitter.im/The-Neutron-Foundation).

# Dependencies
Before installing/building/running neutron, you should first install the dependencies. you can do this via `pip3` or any other package manager. The dependencies required are:

* [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)
* [SLY](https://github.com/dabeaz/sly)

# Basic Usage
To use, run the filename as the first argument. It is recommended to use the python interpreter to run the code (just run the `neutron` folder), like so:

```
python3 neutron path/to/neutron/file.ntn
```

The filename for neutron files is `.ntn`. For example, `important_file.ntn`. If you want to use the compiled binaries, on Unix-like systems, you could do:

```
./neutron.bin path/to/neutron/file.ntn
```
